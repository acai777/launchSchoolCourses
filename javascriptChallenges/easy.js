/* Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.
A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

A triangle must also satisfy two other conditions:
1) all sides must be of length > 0
2) the sum of lengths of any two side must be greater than the length of the third side
